# Averaged Wiener process autocovariance and autocorrelation matrices and the code to verify those with a Monte Carlo simulation
Gives analytic formulas to calculate autocovariance matrix and autocorrelation matrix for averaged Wiener process with equal-distance time points. Is supplemented with Python numpy code to verify those formulas with a Monte Carlo simulation.

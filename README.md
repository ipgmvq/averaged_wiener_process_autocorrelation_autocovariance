# Averaged Wiener process autocovariance and autocorrelation matrices and the code to verify those with a Monte Carlo simulation
This repository gives analytic formulas to calculate the autocovariance matrix and autocorrelation matrix for an averaged Wiener process with equal-distance time points. Those matrices are supplemented with Python numpy code to verify those formulas with a Monte Carlo simulation.

The file is in the format for Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
